## About Me

I have no experience in this area, but I have a great desire to develop. In my opinion, I have the necessary abilities for high-quality study and formation of myself in this area.

At the age of 30, I consider one of my strengths the absence of fear of the unknown, even with a lack of knowledge and experience, if I have thoughts that nothing will work out, I do not stop. On the contrary, it gives me an incentive to prove to myself that nothing is impossible. And no external factors can distance you from the dream that you have built in your mind.
